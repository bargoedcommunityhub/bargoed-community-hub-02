                            <h2>Right From The Start<br>1995</h2><br>
                            <p>Bargoed Community Hub grew out of  the Right from the Start charity which was set up in 1995  to 'safeguard, protect and preserve the good health both mental and physical of children and parents, to prevent cruelty, maltreatment, relieve sickness, poverty and need amongst children and parents, promoting the education of the public in better standards of childcare'. It was the inspiration of a headteacher in Hengoed but had support from the Health Service, Social Services and the Police who all recognised how necessary it was to work together to achieve these aims. The scheme was a forerunner of and was used to develop the Wales Sure Start scheme  brought in a few years later.<br><br>For 25 years staff worked with individual families and groups throughout Caerphilly Borough adapting as demand and services available changed which led to opening a residential 'half way house' for young parents in Aberbargoed.</p>

                            <p>But over the last few years there has been a growing desire to broaden focus to the community as a whole and move towards social enterprise. A physical move to Bargoed High Street came in 2018 when The Community Hub was opened. Since then a combination of external circumstances, personnel changes and policy decisions has produced the current organisation.</p>

                            <p>As this new community project started out an old one which was ending because Bargoed Settlement was wound up and gave some of that charity's money to help establish the Community Hub which was a lovely piece of symmetry. The Settlement was set up by a Bargoed teacher in the 1930's inspiring the local community to take action to improve their lives in times of particular difficulty which they did very successfully. The Community Hub seems like a modern day version of that significant bit of Bargoed history.</p>
